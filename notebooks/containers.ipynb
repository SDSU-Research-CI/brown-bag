These facts allow for trucks, cranes, ships and trains to load, transport and unload containers in a uniform manner. Shipping companies can transport containers from different companies with various products, so long as the products fit into a shipping container."

    "### 1. üîí Isolated Runtime Environment\n",
    "Each container runs in its own isolated environment which means that it can run alongside other apps without affecting them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could have two containerized applications \"A\" and \"B\" that both use the same library \"Lib X.\" However, app A uses Lib X version 1.0 and app B uses version 2.0. If we were running these apps on the same computer without containerizing them we would have to install and configure some sort of environment management to make sure each app has access to the version of Lib X that it needs. Running these in a container frees us from that concern, as each app is packaged up with its own copy and version of Lib X.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. üöõ Portability\n",
    "Because containers are standardized, you can run a container on your laptop and, without modifying it, you can run the same container on the Instructional Cluster or any cloud with a container runtime service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. üîÅ Reproducability\n",
    "Since containers are self-contained, you can easily share a copy of your container and allow others to run it and get the same output. This saves time as you can avoid having to troubleshoot running on different operating systems, having different library versions, using different file layouts, forgetting configuration steps etc."
