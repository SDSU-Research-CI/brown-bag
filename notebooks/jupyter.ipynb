    "Jupyter Notebooks are valuable because they make coding and data analysis approachable with an interactive GUI and they eliminate the need to install several tools, thus lending themselves to collaboration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allow you to take rich notes; write, execute, and debug code; and display data and reports -- all from one web-based application. Let's condsider for a moment what software you would need to replace Jupyter Notebooks. You would need a notetaking app like Microsoft OneNote, Google Docs or Evernote. You would also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, JetBrains or PyCharm. You would also need tools to interact with and analyze data such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Minitab. At a minimum you would need to install and maintain 3 software tools, not to mention you would need to keep your work in sync across them all and need to constantly context switch between them.\n",

    "With the interactivity and consolidation of several tools, Jupyter Notebooks makes it easy to collaborate with colleagues and teammates. All you need to do is share your notebook with them and they can instantly read your notes, run your code and interpret your analyses."
