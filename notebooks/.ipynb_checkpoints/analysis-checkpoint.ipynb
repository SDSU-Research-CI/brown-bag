    "If you were to run a Jupyter Notebook on your local machine then you would also have to install any packages that you might need.

If you do a lot of work, or need to install several versions of software in different environments for different projects, then it can really add up.\n",

If you do find that you need to install software in addition to what is already provided, please reach out to Research and Cyberinfrastructure and we can discuss creating a customized image as part of our [Software Factory](https://it.sdsu.edu/research/services/software-factory). Let's see containers in action in the context of Jupyter Notebooks with some simple data analysis."
